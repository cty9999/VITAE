# Model-based Trajectory Inference for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Using Deep Learning with a Mixture Prior





## Dependency

Our Python package is available on PyPi and the user can install the CPU version with the following command. To enable GPU for Tensorflow, one should install CUDA dependencies and `tensorflow-gpu` package. We also recommend to use `conda`, `miniconda` or `virtualenv` to manage Python environment and install the package in the new environment.

```
>> pip install pyvitae
```

After installing all required packages, one can open the Jupyter Notebook via terminal:

```
>>> jupyter notebook
```

The required tensorflow versions are: 

Package|Version
